Recommended Videos The first project from filmmaker Boots Riley since his breakthrough hit Sorry to Bother You is an absurdist social satire that’s equal parts hilarious and incendiary, with Jharrel Jerome playing 13-foot tall teenager Cootie as he gets to grips with entering society for the very first time having been sheltered from the world his whole life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And Cootie being 13 feet tall, and entering society as one of the most purest, most naive people, to be in contact with all of these characters just felt like something that we feel when we enter new settings. I was totally down for the ride.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true><strong>Olivia Washington:</strong> I agree. You know, I think that it’s something so different. And we’ve been saying about the show; you have to see it to understand it. So reading it even, we felt like we had a good understanding about it when we were making it. But then when we got to set and then saw the final product, we were like, “Oh, wow, this is something.” I mean, it’s Boots Riley, how are you not going to participate?</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false><strong>Kara, you’ve got a couple of standout monologues at various points. Did you find that to be a daunting prospect at all when the day came after reading the scripts, or was it a challenge you relished given both your background on the stage and desire to do justice to the source material?</strong></p><p data-characters=825 data-current-count=1118 data-injectable=true><strong>Kara Young:</strong> Wow, that’s such a great question. Um, so I auditioned, I auditioned with one of the monologues – and we’re gonna keep that on the hush because a lot of people don’t know what’s gonna happen, Scott! – but I auditioned with that. And I actually, I absolutely felt like it was absolutely connected to what we do in the theater, in regards to feeling like you’re changing the world, feeling like you’re sending a message out into the ether, and that that message will be passed along. You know, how many audience members are in the theater? Somebody’s going to take something from that and pass it. So when I auditioned, I felt like that was incredibly important to me, in regards to a character that’s going to be viewed by potentially millions of people.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false><strong>Olivia Washington:</strong> And not to mention, but she’s now a two-time Tony nominee, she knows what she’s doing and she does it well!</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true><strong>We’ll dance around spoilers, but let’s just say there’s a “certain scene” that people will be talking about once they’ve seen it, Olivia. As an actor, what was your reaction when you read that? And how do you go about preparing for something like that as a performer, and from a logistical point of view?</strong></p><p data-characters=812 data-current-count=812 data-injectable=true><strong>Olivia Washington:</strong> Right? I think as a performer, it’s always a little daunting, but it’s the type of vulnerability that someone… Yeah, I guess… is that a spoiler? Not really. Anyway, there’s a certain amount of vulnerability that has to happen that as an actor, I think you are prepared to give. And I was excited. I called some friends that had done intimate scenes before and I really enjoyed their perspective. It was about bringing joy and this kind of really human moment to to people. And from a logistic point of view, all of my physicality was with a doll – with a 13-foot doll – and Jharrel was always in the room. So he was behind the camera when I was filming. So a lot of my stuff, I was cradling and cuddling and caressing this giant doll. You have to see!</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false><strong>I’m a Virgo premieres on Prime Video this Friday, June 23. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You can check out our review of the series here</a>, as well as our exclusive interviews with executive producer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Ellenberg</a>, as well as stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Allius Barnes and Brett Gray</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymxMKlrKyhppp6qrrTnqmvoZWserTAwKuqZqORp65uxc6upaBlkaOxbrvLoq2imV2srrS0yKeeraeeYsGiuMpmoKZlkWLDqr7GqGSappRisLa%2ByKisrGWcpMOmedKcnKedo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
