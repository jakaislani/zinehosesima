In fact, he apparently is not a big fan of social media just like several of Rev. Run‚Äôs sons. He only has 10 posts, and his big brother <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Simmons Jr</a></strong>. has only 30 posts. His other older brother, Diggy Simmons&nbsp;‚Äî&nbsp;while he has more posts than both of his brothers combined ‚Äî&nbsp; he too isn‚Äôt that much of a social media user. He only has a total of 65 posts.</p><p>In former rapper Rev. Run‚Äôs comments, fans expressed their thoughts over how much Russell has grown and how much he looks the same. One person wrote,‚ÄùOMG Russy is 25!!???!!!??? This makes me feel old as dirt!! He was just 8 years old like a year agoüòÇ Where did thw time go??? Happy Birthday Russy!!‚Äù Someone else said, ‚ÄúDude still looks 12.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pjimage-53-1-600x420.jpg><p>Another fan said Russell was beginning to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">look like</a> his oldest brother Joseph, whose nickname is Jo Jo. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe how old you are now, you look like Jojo these days. Just a Runs house fan here,‚Äù that person wrote. Jo Jo, who is a rapper, joined in on the comments to show his little brother some love, typing ‚ÄúBig Russy.‚Äù</p><p>Since he did not post about it, it‚Äôs not clear what Russell might have done to celebrate his 25th birthday. Besides Diggy, 25, and Jo Jo, 31, Russell has two older sisters: <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angela Simmons</a></strong>, 33, and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanessa Simmons</a></strong>, 38. After losing their baby girl, Victoria Anne Simmons, a few days after Rev. Run‚Äôs wife Justine gave birth to her, the couple decided to adopt their next baby girl named Miley Simmons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49xZmxpX5nCpbGMrKuipJxiubC7yqxkampdm66vv4yaqZ5lo528pLfEnWSorpWnerOx1WaprqajYsawwc2gnKtlo6S7br7UrKqyq12WvbGxwKuYp5uVYq6nwMSrZKuZoKWys3nWoqqhnaNitaq5jJpkoZmgpcZursirq6Gcka58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
