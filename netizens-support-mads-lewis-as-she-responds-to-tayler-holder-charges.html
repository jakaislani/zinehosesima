Mads Lewis has a devoted following that has grown since the podcast’s introduction on YouTube. Another user pleaded for Mads to come back, writing:</p><p>Mads talked about Charly Jordan, the influencer who has dated Tayler on and off throughout the program. After what happened the previous year, Mads expressed her consternation over Jordan and Holder getting back together. Also claiming that she believes all of Tayler’s charges are true, Mads Lewis made the implication that she was a victim of Holder’s sexual assault. She remarked:</p><p>Lewis responded, “certainly,” when Portnoy asked if this meant that all of her accusations against Holder were valid. She added that Holder had not written her a letter demanding she ceases and desists. Mads noticed:</p><p>Furthermore, you cannot email or text the victim a stop and desist when there is only one person and there are “victims.” You are not allowed to do that. I’m only saying that I didn’t receive a cease-and-desist letter.</p><p>As soon as the program aired, Lewis’ supporters started to grow on social media. She was allegedly one of the influencers Tayler Holder assaulted, according to some, and one Twitter user wrote:</p><p>“I was talking about Mads Lewis, but she did have something happen to her, and she informed us that Tayler Holder SA’d her,” the speaker said.</p><p>At the same time, Mads is receiving a lot of love and support in the podcast’s YouTube comment section. A number of the accusations made against Tayler Holder have already elicited strong responses. The situation worsened when Daniel Keemstar, the host of YouTube’s Drama Alert, said that Holder was the target of “horrendous” accusations from sources.</p><p>Tayler Holder will be subject to serious allegations from multiple claimed victims, a credible source has reported. The #DramaAlert team is gathering data at the moment. I wouldn’t typically tweet this much right now. Taylor acknowledged that accusations were leveled at BFFs, nonetheless.</p><p>Tayler did not deny any of the allegations while stating on a BFFs podcast episode that he is handling the matter offline.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>According To Evan Roberts, Every Women Is A Hero For Surviving Childbirth</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TIKTOKER</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Shayna Michelle | Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>The TikTok star and social media influencer Shayna Michelle is known for posting lip-sync and modeling videos to her channel's 220,000 subscribers.
