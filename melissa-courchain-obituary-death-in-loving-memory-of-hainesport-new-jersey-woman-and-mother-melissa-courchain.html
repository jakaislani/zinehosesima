The odds were stacked against her for years… decades.. and she fought so hard and won for soooo long. Melissa Courchain lit up a room with her dancing, wiggles and laugh. Despite her condition, she was an amazing ATHLETE! A singer and dancer. I played field hockey and softball with her from middle school days through high school. She was an amazing wife to her husband Bob and a momma to little Austin. I knew her family well back in the day.
