The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation claimed that the investigation is still ongoing but refused to release any other details.&nbsp;Summer was around three feet tall and forty pounds when she was last seen. She was wearing a pink blouse, gray jeans, and was maybe barefoot when she disappeared.&nbsp;On June 15 and 16, a red pickup truck driver was sighted along Ben Hill Road in Rogersville. It has full-sized ladder racks and white buckets in the bed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Summer-Wells-2.jpg alt="Summer Wells" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Summer’s disappearance is still being investigated, with detectives looking into all possibilities.&nbsp;Investigators said they have executed various search warrants and devoted thousands of man hours to the probe over the last year.

Furthermore, Rose Marie Bly, Bly’s sister, went missing in Wisconsin in 2009 in an unsolved case, and both of Summer’s parents have a history of criminal involvement.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Don Wells</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Summer Wells</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrqWdmr9uw8Slo6xllpbBqbHRZq6rp6SaeqJ5y56rrZ2iYrOzu8xmp6uho6S7brXNZqmerJGhtqLAyKilZp6fp3qptdJmm5qtl53Bpr7SZpibnKWYwaq7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
