LG was one of the first companies to demonstrate a Moorestown based phone as recently as earlier this year. Just 54 minutes ago however LG announced that starting in Q4 2010 it will be shipping smartphones based on NVIDIA's Tegra 2.
We first introduced you to Tegra 2 back at CES 2010. It's NVIDIA's second generation smartphone SoC with a pair of ARM Cortex A9 cores (ARM's first out-of-order architecture). The dual core CPU will run at 1GHz."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just 54 minutes ago however LG announced that starting in Q4 2010 it will be shipping smartphones based on&nbsp;<a href=#>NVIDIA's Tegra 2</a>.</p><p>We first&nbsp;<a href=#>introduced you to Tegra 2 back at CES 2010</a>. It's NVIDIA's second generation smartphone SoC with a pair of ARM Cortex A9 cores (ARM's first out-of-order architecture). The dual core CPU will run at 1GHz. Tegra 2 also features NVIDIA's own mobile GPU, although we know nothing of its architecture or how well it stacks up to high end GPUs from Imagination Technologies. NVIDIA calls it a GeForce GPU however I'd be surprised if there's any similarities between it and what's shipping in desktop GeForce GPUs today.</p><p>LG's press release is pretty light on details although we do get some performance projections. LG states that web browsing can be up to 2x faster and gaming performance can be up to 5x faster compared to single core processors running at 1GHz. If we're conservative and assume that is in comparison to Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC then we'd expect Quake 3 frame rates at just under 100 fps. Web browsing at 2x the speed of Snapdragon would be much faster than anything we've seen to date.</p><p>LG mentions that Tegra 2 will enable 1080p HD video playback however with no indication of bitrate it's too early to get excited about that claim. TI's OMAP 4 will also have 1080p support when it ships in phones next year. The same is true for Intel's&nbsp;<a href=#>Moorestown</a>&nbsp;based devices.</p><p>Obviously SoC speed isn't all that matters, LG has to deliver a compelling smartphone design. The first LG Tegra 2 smartphones will be a part of its Optimus Series of smartphones, most likely running Android.</p><p>Below is the full press release from LG:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=p1><b>LG DEVELOPS POWERFUL SMARTPHONES WITH NVIDIA TEGRA 2 PROCESSOR</b></p><p class=p2><i>LG First to Announce Smartphone with Dual-Core CPU based on NVIDIA Tegra, the World’ s Most Advanced Mobile Processor</i></p><p class=p2><b>SEOUL, Sept. 7, 2010 </b>– LG Electronics (LG) announced today that it will introduce a series of fast, powerful smartphones starting in the fourth quarter of 2010 utilizing the second generation NVIDIA<span class=s1>® </span>TegraTM mobile processor, Tegra 2.
