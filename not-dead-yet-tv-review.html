In the five episodes provided to critics, each ghost is played with fervor by actors of various amounts of clout, all imparting an important lesson to Nell, whether they mean to or not.&nbsp;</p><p>“Not Dead Yet” also features a delightful cast of recurring characters, including “New Girl” alum <a href=#>Hannah Simone</a> as Sam, who matches Rodriguez’s internal glow as Nell’s best friend. <a href=#>Lauren Ash</a> has a lot of fun as the imperious and out-of-touch boss, while Jimmy Bellinger seems to have a great time as the unpaid intern and Nell’s presumptuous rival.</p><p>Most of the workplace drama reads like a writer’s fantasy of what it is to work at a newspaper—there are the occasional lobster lunches for inspiration, for one. The good people putting together the SoCal Independent may worry about numbers, but no one gets laid off, everyone makes a living wage, and Nell appears to write just one column a week.</p><p>Adding to the fantasy of it all, the characters inhabit a cheerful Los Angeles where Nell walks around her neighborhood; everyone she meets lives close by in a city famous for its spaced-out neighborhoods, and the general vibe is bright and airy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqenpGKxpq3DZrCerF2pw26%2BxK%2Bgnq8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
