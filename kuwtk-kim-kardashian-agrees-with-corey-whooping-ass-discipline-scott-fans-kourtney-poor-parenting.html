Kim was present at the table while Scott and Corey were arguing about disciplining children, and it was extremely interesting to notice that she had nothing to say. Kim who usually has a strong opinion about literally everything under the sun was unusually quiet. Fans immediately began speculating that it could be because Kim was on Corey’s side. A fan tweeted, “Kim’s silence about the spanking subject spoke volumes. Kim disciplines her kids both kris and Khloe have mentioned it before. Kourtney's son reign was embarrassing on Ellen. Meanwhile, Kim’s kids sat quietly #KUWTK”. Another fan wrote, “Kim agreed with Corey though, as well as Kris. That was apparent. I know Kanye tears North’s little behind up #KUWTK”.</p><p>What was appalling though was the way Kourt insisted on defending her children’s poor behavior. When her oldest son, Mason got into trouble at school for threatening to beat up another kid, she just let his behavior slide by without grounding him or making him understand his mistakes. So, when her daughter Penelope who scratched her nanny is being discussed, and momager Kris commented that she never had such complaints from anybody about her children (referring to Kar-Jenner sisters and Rob). Kourt immediately revealed that she scratched Kris as a child several times, and beat up her nannies regularly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fans immediately began calling Kourt out for being a poor parent. A fan shared, “Kourtney if you keep letting them hit you as kids they’re gonna feel super comfortable punching you in the face as an adult! You’re raising abusers! Woman up and become a mom. Not just a birth giver! #KUWTK”. “I think Scott needs full custody. Kourtney isn’t doing her job as a parent. Sorry, not sorry.&nbsp; #KUWTK”, suggested a fan. Another viewer wrote, “So the footage of Kourtney's kids tonight was that supposed to be showing them obeying her I’m not seeing the good parent people claim Kourtney is #KUWTK”.</p><p>You can tune in to ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ season 17, every Sunday night at 9 p.m., only on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoo6Wswax5yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlkZy%2FprHSZq6irJhisLC%2BxLJksKCfpL2qusZmmKyrXZm2tK%2FIqaOippViwKS7061kn5meqHqsu9Srq6edqWK9sLvRZqeaqpWjwaq6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
