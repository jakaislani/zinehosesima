 Answer
BX has a bonding strip to allow the casing to be a grounding conductor. It does not contain a ground wire. MC cable has a full size ground wire the casing is not a grounding conductor.
 Herein, what is the difference between armored cable and MC cable? Some will refer to this cable as Greenfield cable. Armored cable (AC) first appears in the 1903 NEC."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Armored cable (AC) first appears in the 1903 NEC. The biggest difference between the two cable systems is that MC has full size ground wire while AC uses a combination of the jacket and a thin bonding strip or wire to function as the equipment ground.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, what is MC cable used for?&nbsp;</h3><p>A. Type MC cable can be used for service-entrance conductors, feeders and branch circuits in many applications. Section 330.10 of the National Electrical Code includes the general uses permitted for Type MC cable.</p><h3>Also to know is, what is a BX cable?</h3><p>BX Cable and Wiring Basics Going under alternative names such as metallic sheathed cable, type AC, MC, Greenfield, or armored cable, BX cable is a collection of plastic-coated insulated wires (typically 14- or 12-gauge), bundled together and protected by a ribbon-like metal sheathing.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is BX cable safe?</h3><p>Modern BX wiring, properly installed, is safe. It is acceptable to the latest version of the National Electrical Code (2017 NEC Article 320). But safety of an existing BX system does depend on its age, type and how it was installed.</p><h3>29 Related Question Answers Found</h3><h3>Does armored cable need to be grounded?</h3><p>If the fiber-optic cable in a system needs extra protection, there is an alternative to using conduit or a bonded and grounded conductive cable, such as an all-dielectric armored cable. Because all-dielectric armored cable has no metallic components, there is no need to ground or bond the cable.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is MC cable considered conduit?</h3><p>MC Cable is a cable not a raceway. Raceway. An enclosed channel of metal or nonmetallic materials designed expressly for holding wires, cables, or busbars, with additional functions as permitted in this Code.</p><h3>What does MC cable stand for?</h3><p>Their flexible metal armor provides mechanical protection of the electrical conductors while enabling them to bend around corners. Armored cable (Type AC) and Metal Clad cable (Type MC) have a flexible metal armor of similar outward appearance, but that is where the similarity ends.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What type wire is in MC cable?</h3><p>Metal-clad cable comes in several varieties, but the type you’ll find at most home centers is three insulated wires (two circuit conductors and a green equipment grounding conductor) protected by a flexible armor usually made from aluminum. MC cable is identified by the gauge of the wire, not the diameter of the armor.</p><h3>Is MC cable allowed in hospitals?</h3><p>Southwire HCF MCAP Type MC Cable – “All Purpose” is suitable for use as follows: Branch-circuit wiring for general purpose, non-essential electrical systems in patient care areas of hospitals, medical and other health care facilities. Such areas include nursing homes, dental offices, and outpatient facilites.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is MC cable suitable for damp locations?</h3><p>Type AC cable is approved by the NEC for use only in dry locations. In order to comply with the NEC for use in wet locations, interlocked Type MC Cable must have a corrosion resistant jacket and wet location rated conductors. A common style cable that is rated for wet locations is a standard MC Cable with a PVC jacket.</p><h3>What does MC cable mean?</h3><p>MC Cable: A Technical Definition The definition in Article 330 of the 2011 National Electrical Code® (NEC®(ANSI/NFPA 70 Standard) identifies MC Cable as a factory assembly of one or more insulated circuit conductors enclosed in an armor of interlocking metal tape, or smooth or corrugated metallic sheath.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How many MC wires go through a metal stud?</h3><p>We have 2 (2) 3/4 flex and (1) 12/4 MC running through the same factory punched 1 1/2″ X 3″ hole in metal studs.</p><h3>How do you use Armoured cable?</h3><p>MC cable has a green-insulated ground wire, used like the bare ground wire in NM cable. Step 1: Bend Cable. Bend the cable about 10 inches from its end and squeeze with your hand until the coils of the armor come apart. Step 2: Twist Cable. Step 3: Cut Exposed Coil. Step 4: Cut the Wires. Step 5: Remove Excess.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Can you bury armored cable?</h3><p>Armoured cables and cables having an earthed metal sheath suitable for use as a protective conductor may be buried directly in the ground without further protection, except against corrosion, which may be negated by the provision of a plastic covering.</p><h3>Can you use MC cable with plastic boxes?</h3><p>Plastic boxes do not have the proper clamps to secure MC cable. Its against code to run MC cable into a plastic box. Plastic boxes do not have the proper clamps to secure MC cable.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>5</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSdoZabsrOxzZycZpqVqcSmsc1mmbFlk5avrbGMmqWdZZ2YeqStwaWcZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
