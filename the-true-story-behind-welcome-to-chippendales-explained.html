The business was founded by Indian entrepreneur and American migrant, Somen Banerjee (aka Steve). Banerjee purchased a failed Los Angeles bar called Destiny II in 1979 and renamed it ‘Chippendales’. What made his business a success was that he hosted exotic dance nights for women, which became very popular. The club managed to spread across the U.S. with clubs opening in other states such as New York and Colorado. The club also provided tours across the United States and Europe.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>As the company became popular, Banerjee feared potential competition and decided to deal with them. The entrepreneur targeted former Chippendales employees and his business partner, Nick De Noia, through the help of a hitman. Before De Noia’s death, he and Banerjee didn’t see eye to eye about the company’s future and ended their partnership in 1980. The deal was struck on the back of the napkin, which granted De Noia the rights and half the profits for the Chippendales touring show.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Banerjee was arrested and pleaded guilty to murder, arson, and racketeering in 1994. He was sentenced to 26 years of prison but was reported to be found dead in his cell due to suicide.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>Despite its bloody past, Chippendales still exists to this day. The tour group performs shows outside of the U.S. and in 2020, they released workout videos to entertain people during the lockdowns. Chippendales is now known for its male dancers and burlesque-like shows. But with every success story comes a dark and deadly underbelly behind the scenes.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>Welcome to Chippendales is now available to stream on Disney Plus and Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmq6utlWLAtbvRsmSbnZieu6V51p6jnKedmnq1u4ycn6KooJq7pa3LnqpmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
