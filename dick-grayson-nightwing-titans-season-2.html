This intel comes to us via the same source who’s supplied us with accurate DC scoops in the past – for instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viola Davis is returning</a> for&nbsp;The Suicide Squad&nbsp;and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Adam will be in</a> Shazam! 3 (which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachary Levi has since confirmed</a>) – so we have no reason to doubt it.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>This news also makes a lot of sense with the character’s arc across the show so far. Apart from season 2’s general interest in giving the cast new costumes, Dick’s darker outlook and wish to go at it alone without Batman fit his Nightwing persona better than his Robin one. Plus, the recent trailer for the season teases that Dick will be furthering his aims to reinvent himself as his own hero. This time with Bruce Wayne’s blessing, it seems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/preview-TIT201a003520V1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/preview-TIT201a010120V1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/preview-TIT201a010620V1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/preview-TIT201a019220V1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/preview-TIT201a029520V1.jpg><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Of course, the Titans will be joined by a range of new characters in season 2, including Superboy, Aqualad and Ravager. Deathstroke will serve as the big bad, while other outlets have reported that both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Luthor</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superman</a> will drop by this year as well, which would make sense considering Superboy’s arrival. WGTC has also heard that spinoffs could be in the works for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawk and Dove</a>, but WB has yet to confirm that.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false><strong>Titans</strong>&nbsp;season 2 kicks off with “Trigon,” tying up the loose ends of last year’s battle with Raven’s demonic father.
