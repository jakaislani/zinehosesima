Recommended Videos The latest season of Netflix’s Love is Blind is undoubtedly the most problematic season ever aired. If you’ve seen all seven episodes released by Netflix so far, then you know exactly what I’m talking about. However, fans of the show who have yet to succumb to a late-night binge-athon might want to stop reading here as there are many spoilers ahead."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They clearly didn’t do their homework <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when selecting the cast</a>, which led to exes Uche Okoroha and Lydia Velez Gonzalez recognizing each other in the pods. Also, unlike previous seasons, they only followed the story of three engaged couples, which got widdled down to two after JP Pierce and Taylor Rue called it quits after a disastrous time together in Mexico.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>That leaves viewers with just two couples left in the experiment, neither of which I’ve found very interesting. I’m far more invested in the drama between Uche and Lydia, and frankly, I don’t think either of the remaining engaged couples should say, “I do” at the altar.</p><h2 id=h-timeline-of-stacy-and-izzy-s-relationship data-injectable=false>Timeline of Stacy and Izzy’s relationship</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Is Blind (@loveisblindnetflix)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Izzy Zapata and Stacy Snyder made a late connection in the pods. At the beginning of the experiment, all of the women were vying for Izzy’s attention, but it ultimately came down to Stacy and Johnie Maraist. After Johnie dropped some heavy details about her past relationships, Izzy chose Stacy, and the two got engaged.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>During their time in Mexico, Stacy and Izzy seemed to have the most natural connection among the couples. Their fun-loving personalities made things easy until they went home and tested their relationship in the real world. She hit him with hard truths about her financial expectations, and it quickly became apparent that the two weren’t on the same page.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Stacy’s dad, Dale, pushed the issue further during a sit down with Izzy, ensuring his daughter’s fiance understood that he would be expected to help pay Stacy’s mortgage and pick up the check whenever they went to dinner. Despite reassuring the man that he could handle it, Izzy’s face told a different story. In my opinion, this was the beginning of the end for this couple.</p><h2 id=h-did-stacy-and-izzy-get-married-on-love-is-blind data-injectable=false>Did Stacy and Izzy get married on&nbsp;Love is Blind?</h2><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=868 data-injectable=true>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Style Caster</a>, Stacy and Izzy were issued a marriage license on May 20 from the Harris County Clerk’s Office in Texas. On Aug. 29, the office processed their marriage license, but the couple never returned it. Since they aren’t legally married, the couple likely split up before their wedding, or someone says “I don’t” at the altar. Adding to suspicions that they’re no longer together, fans out with another woman.</p><h2 id=h-is-izzy-cheating-on-stacy-with-another-woman data-injectable=false>Is Izzy cheating on Stacy with another woman?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Izzy Zapata (@izzyzapata_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported that fans caught Izzy with a woman in Hermosa Beach, CA, on Monday. Photos show him and the woman, who definitely isn’t Stacy, getting cozy at Hermosa Ink Collective. At one point, Izzy has his hand on the woman’s leg, indicating that the two are more than just friends.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;Love is Blind&nbsp;star also posted photos on his Instagram page taken by the mystery woman the same day. He’s seen wearing the same grey sweatsuit he has on in the pictures taken at the tattoo shop.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-izzy-s-new-mystery-woman data-injectable=false>Who is Izzy’s new mystery woman?</h2><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>While it’s clear Izzy and Stacy never got married, the woman in the photos may not be a new relationship. Izzy may have been in California filming the&nbsp;Love is Blind&nbsp;reunion episode, which means he would be around other less-known members of the cast. Could one of them be in the photos? Likely we’ll find out more in time! Either way, season 5 clearly has the lowest success rate among couples involved in the experiment.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>So, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is love truly blind?</a> Probably not for Izzy and Stacy, but be sure to keep following their relationship when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix drops new episodes</a> of&nbsp;Love is Blind&nbsp;on Friday!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZpqqlWK2u8bYZpinnF2owaKv2Gadq6edYrmwwsRmoKxlkqG2r7CMrKuipJxiwbCzxK2fnqpdqbWmecKorKmklah6pLvMqaOerJViv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedOipJ6kmaOybrHXqaOaoZ6asXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
