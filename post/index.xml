Paint. Paint is always an option when it comes to covering particleboard for utilitarian purposes. Surface preparation includes sanding the particleboard with a belt sander, driving nails or staples into the board, and filling holes and seams with wood filler to make it ready for painting or other applications. At least two coats of high-quality floor paint should be applied to the floor.
