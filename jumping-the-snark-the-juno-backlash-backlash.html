I don't buy, for example, that a girl as smart and beautiful as Juno wouldn't have more friends, or that the only two she <i>would</i> have would be a cheerleader and a guy on the school cross-country team whose members inexplicably don't wear jocks while running. And I wonder if she's really stupid enough to think her <i>third</i> over-the-counter pregnancy test in one day would require her to drink a whole gallon of Sunny D -- in which case, as one of DeRogatis's commenters pointed out, "A mild desire to urinate would be the least of your problems..." (A bottle of water? Two cups of naturally diuretic coffee? A wee spot of herbal tea, if caffeine is not your thing?) Turns out, Juno is not such an idiot, and "Juno" is not "Citizen Ruth 2," a scabrous satirical socio-political comedy. It's a more conventional, sentimental romantic comedy about a high school girl in trouble.</p><p><img alt=ellenp.jpg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/scanners/jumping-the-snark-the-juno-backlash-backlash/ellenp.jpg width=275 border=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Juno tests her Sunny D levels.</p><p>But I actually want to say something here in <i>defense</i> of "Juno" -- or, at least, in defense of J.K. Simmons, the splendid actor who plays Mac, Juno's dad. (<a href=#>Alison Janney</a>, <a href=#>Michael Cera</a>, <a href=#>Jason Bateman</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> also deserve as much credit for the success of "Juno" as lead actress <a href=#>Ellen Page</a>.)</p><p>In a <i>New York Times</i> Op-Ed piece earlier this week ("<a href=#>Sex and the Teenage Girl</a>"), Caitlin Flanagan writes:</p><p>For the most part, the tone of the movie is comedic and jolly, but there is a moment when Juno tells her father about her condition [pregnancy], and he shakes his head in disappointment and says, “I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.”</p><p>Female viewers flinch when he says it, because his words lay bare the bitterly unfair truth of sexuality: female desire can bring with it a form of punishment no man can begin to imagine, and so it is one appetite women and girls must always regard with caution. Because Juno let her guard down and had a single sexual experience with a sweet, well-intentioned boy, she alone is left with this ordeal of sorrow and public shame.</p>Yes, there's some truth there, and the movie is not unaware of it, but I also think it's a misreading of the scene she mentions, and the movie as a whole.<p>&nbsp;When Mac says that line about "the kind of girl who knew when to say when" -- not until near the end of the scene -- he's saying not so much what he really thinks (both he and Juno's stepmother Bren [Janney] are in shock, as they later discuss when they're alone) as something he feels he is obligated to say as a parent because, well, isn't that the kind of thing a father is supposed to say? It feels like an afterthought: "Oh, I should probably express my obligatory authority-figure scolding here, before I forget, lest anyone think I am implicitly condoning reckless sexual behavior."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrJuRo7umvtJooa6loJ67qHnToZxmq56Wv6x506GcZqKlo7xursCcoqWZo516o63CpKOaq5g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
