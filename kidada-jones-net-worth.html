She is also known as an actress, and her career has been active since 1994.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Kidada Jones is, as of mid-2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Kidada’s net worth is over $3 million, accumulated through her successful involvement in the fashion industry, and her career as an actress.</p><h3>Kidada Jones Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Kidada Jones spent her childhood with her younger sister in Bel-Air, where she was raised by her father, <a href=#>Quincy Jones</a>, a reputed composer and band leader, and <a href=#>Peggy Lipton</a>, who was known as an actress; her sister is <a href=#>Rashida Jones</a>, who is also known as an actress. She attended Fairfax High School in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and upon matriculation enrolled at the Los Angeles Institute for Design and Merchandising, but quit education to pursue her career in the fashion industry.</p><p>Thus, Kidada’s career began when she started working as a celebrity stylist for Vibe Magazine – her father’s publication – and reached enormous popularity after working with <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> and styling him for its cover in 1995. This marked the beginning of an increase of her net worth. Her talent was spotted by designer <a href=#>Tommy Hilfiger</a>, who hired her to work with him, and subsequently launched an advertising campaign, which was centered on Kidada’s projects, alongside other designers such as <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, <a href=#>Oliver Hudson</a>, <a href=#>Tamia</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Richie</a>, increasing her popularity and her net worth. She worked for Tommy for ten years, after which she designed a clothing line for <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> for the next several years.</p><p>In 2005, Kidada began collaborating with the Walt Disney Company, where she designed a line of clothes named Kidada for Disney Couture, which added a considerable amount to her wealth.</p><p>Additionally, Kidada also appeared as a fashion model in various fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Elle and Harper’s Bazaar, among others, all of which increased her net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Apart from her successful career in the fashion industry, Kidada also tried herself as an actress. She made her debut appearance in the role of Jesse in the film entitled “Black & White” in 1999, which was followed by another role, in the film “Thicker Than Water” (1999) playing Brandy. In the following year, she starred alongside her mother in the film “Intern”, after which she had small roles in such titles as “Empire” (2002) and “Proud” (2004). Most recently, she has appeared in the short video “Jay-Z Feat. Beyoncé: Part II – On The Run” (2014). All of these appearances contributed to her net worth.</p><p>When it comes to speak about her personal life, Kidada Jones was married to Jeffrey Nash from 2003 to 2006. Previously, she was engaged to Tupac Shakur in 1996, at the time when he was murdered, and she was also in a relationship with LL Cool J (2002-2003).</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.625><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kidada Jones</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 15, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 7" (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Peggy Lipton, Quincy Jones</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Siblings</td><td>Rashida Jones, Quincy Jones III, Jolie Jones Levine, Martina Jones, Kenya Julia Miambi Sarah Jones, Rachel Jones</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Tupac Shakur</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428588/</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>Proud Proud, Empire, The Intern, Thicker than Water, Black and White</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=11.892626131953><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=8><td>1</td><td>Kidada's father is African-American, and also has smaller amounts of English, Scottish, and Welsh, ancestry (some of his African ancestors were from the Tikar people of Cameroon).
