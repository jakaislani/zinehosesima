Both are great, but these Beyond Chicken Nuggets are the way to go if you’re in the mood for fake meat that tastes like fake meat rather than real chicken. As my colleague Jordan Myrick pointed out, sometimes fake meat that’s too realistic can be a turn-off for people who don’t eat meat. If you want your fried soy protein to taste like fried soy protein, Beyond is the best vegan chicken for you.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-9daa087f9decf5b1deb2643cd9d1f5dc">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d4ab66></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegan chicken nuggets" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BEST_VEGAN_CHICKEN_INSET_05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Vegan Chicken Nuggets</p><strong>Impossible Chicken Nuggets</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>Impossible Chicken Nuggets are the vegan chicken nuggets to end all vegan chicken nuggets. They’re flavorful, they’re juicy, and they’re genuinely chicken-y. Like, dark meat chicken-y. It’s really impressive, but it’s what we’ve come to expect from Impossible. They helped change the <a href=#>veggie burger</a> game, and they’ve done the same with vegan chicken, too. If you’re looking for a fun vegan snack for you or something to feed your vegetarian niece and nephew, this is the best vegan chicken to buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-05486db5cad21b35389c5f0c47edf9d8">Credit: Merc / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ce8f44></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegan buffalo wings" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BEST_VEGAN_CHICKEN_INSET_04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Vegan Buffalo Wings</p><strong>Daring Vegan Buffalo Wings</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>We recently updated our ranking of the <a href=#>best vegan Buffalo wings</a>, and Daring decisively knocked our previous #1 out of the top spot.

The flavor reminds me of good hot chicken—the kind of hot chicken that comes doused in hot pepper oil rather than a bunch of sauce. The seasoning really gets in there. It’s so savory and super peppery. And there’s a modest kick of heat. In terms of the quality of the “meat,” these chicken pieces are just as good as the original Daring chicken pieces (which you’ll find in the #1 spot), but they’re somewhat less useful since they come pre-seasoned. I took that into account. But if you’re making a vegan Cajun chicken pasta? This is the stuff to buy.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-9daa087f9decf5b1deb2643cd9d1f5dc">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d4984b></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegan chicken strips" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BEST_VEGAN_CHICKEN_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for a Salad</p><strong>Gardein Ultimate Plant Based Chick’n Strips</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>I love Gardein meat. Their breaded vegan “turkey” cutlets are one of my weeknight dinner staples. And, really, Gardein’s fake meat formula has only gotten more delicious as they’ve expanded their offerings. These Ultimate plant-based chicken strips were new info for me; they taste just like the Gardein meat you know and love, but slightly firmer and even better tasting. Gardein’s fake chicken has some pull-apart, but it’s also softer and less tough than some other varieties. This fake chicken (which is totally vegan) comes in convenient little strips that look a lot like real chicken. This is the best vegan chicken to toss onto a salad or to use to make fajitas. The strips don’t come pre-seasoned, so they do need some seasoning. But their blank slate nature is kind of great. They stay moist too; other vegan chicken we tried got pretty dry in the pan.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-05486db5cad21b35389c5f0c47edf9d8">Credit: Merc / Ralphs</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#ce9e42></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best vegan chicken" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BEST_VEGAN_CHICKEN_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Daring Original Plant Chicken Pieces</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I really don’t know how Daring did it. They took soy protein and made it more chicken-y than any brand has been able to manage in the entire history of vegan meat. It’s insane. These chicken pieces pull apart exactly like chicken. It’s like magic. We thought maybe they were made with jackfruit because of the texture, but nope! Daring made a soy protein chicken substitute that is just totally incredible. It’s also very nice and savory. And so, so moist. The plain Daring chicken lands in the top spot because you can season it however you want according to the dish you’re making—or not! Honestly, if you don’t season it, it will still taste great. If you don’t eat meat, buy this vegan grilled chicken, asap.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-link-color has-small-font-size wp-elements-9daa087f9decf5b1deb2643cd9d1f5dc">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> 365 Plant Based Chicken Style Bits Garlic & Herb, Morning Star Farms Veggie Chik’n Strips</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuwsSgmKdlk522pLfEp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
