He speaks French, Italian, and English.&nbsp;Not only that, but he also knows a little Spanish, which comes in handy when speaking with colleague Carlos Sainz Jr. In the different world of Formula One, language acts as a bridge for him.</p><h2>Ascension and Achievements in Racing</h2><p>From karting titles to his Formula One debut with Scuderia Ferrari in 2019, Leclerc has shown to be a force to be reckoned with.
