While there are many predictions on who could take on the role, there is this one fan cast that looks too good to be true – it’s even got me hoping it will come to pass.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>A detailed, albeit hypothetical list of the main cast and crew for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> was shared on a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel vs DC Facebook page</a>. This is no ordinary fan cast. Whoever created this ensured that not only the best of the best would be in on it, but also it made sense and featured a lot of rising actors and actresses that people know today, as well as some recognizable faces.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>For example, it listed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black-ish</a> star, Miles Brown to play the lead role. It also suggested that Fresh of the Boat star and rising actor, Hudson Yang, could play Miles’ roommate, Ganke Lee. Also joining this group of young cast members is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milly Alcock</a>, known for her role as young Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen in HBO’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House of the Dragon</a>, to star as Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman. Is this Spidey-Team exciting or what?</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>This fan casting also didn’t break Spider-Man tradition and listed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">J.K. Simmons</a> to return as Daily Bugle’s J. Jonah Jameson, who appeared in the original trilogy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No Way Home</a>, and most recently, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a>.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>What also makes this fan casting more exciting is how it connects itself to the MCU. For starters, it stated that it’s going to be co-produced by Marvel Studio’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Fegie</a> and Sony’s Amy Pascal. Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther</a> director, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Coogler</a> would be directing this live-action film. It even brought back <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Glover</a>, who played Uncle Aaron in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man Homecoming</a>.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>But one of the biggest cast listings that might break a lot of hearts (presuming it follows the same beats as its animated predecessor), would be the casting of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Holland</a> as Peter Parker. In case you’ve forgotten, during the events of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</a>, Peter Parker dies before Miles becomes the new Spider-Man.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>If these events were to be repeated in the live-action, you could imagine the tears that would flow in theaters around the world. Perhaps it would be on the same level as when Iron Man died in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avengers: Endgame</a>. Fortunately, purely based on the cast that has been built here, we can imagine Peter Parker playing more of a ‘mentor’ role.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=false>At the moment, Sony Pictures hasn’t made any official announcements on who will star in the film. Based on Sony’s track record of late, there’s been some genuine fear that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miles Morales would share a universe with Morbius.</a> It’s currently unknown if this planned film will end up being a part of the MCU, but at least there is hope that somewhere in the vast multiverse, Miles Morales got the live-action adaptation he deserves. Fingers crossed our universe is a part of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon7Kon6m1psDInJilZZyew6Z5wJyroqeeYsCxtcOeqWalkaN6rrXLnqpmpZ%2Bnrq2x0maamqukYrWiv4yppq2dnqm2oriMraZmmpVirm6uyKCenqpdmbKiuIytn5qmXaO8bsPAsmShp52afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
