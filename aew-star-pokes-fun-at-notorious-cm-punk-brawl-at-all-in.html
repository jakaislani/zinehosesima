Punk was&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;<a href=#>fired from AEW</a>&nbsp;and many people were relieved.</p><p>During a recent Instagram Live session, Antony Bowens made a subtle joke about CM Punk and Jack Perry’s Brawl at AEW All In while picking out cards of AEW stars. Bownes referenced getting attacked by Adam Cole’s faction, where he was thrown through ‘real glass.’</p><p>”They threw me through a glass window guys, I have to beat the s*** out of them at some point. And yes it was real glass. It’s also weird how people on Twitter are like ‘Uh ooh fake glass.’ No, it was real glass. I got cut up, if you can’t see the scars around my wrist.”</p><p>Since the infamous brawl at AEW All In, CM Punk made his way back to WWE and is a massive star there. On the other hand, <a href=#>Jack Perry made his NJPW debut at Battle in The Valley</a> last week and tore up his AEW contract. We’ll have to see how both stars will be booked in the coming weeks.</p><p>What do you think of what Anthony Bowens had to say? Do you feel the brawl at All In could have been avoided?
