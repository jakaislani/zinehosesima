According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheatsheet</a>, some have speculated in the past that Justin Herbert has dated model Rylee Jean Kirk, which she denied.

She covered the SEC for ESPN as a sideline reporter before she signed on with the NFL Network in 2016. You can hear Bisciotti with Sam Betesh on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Let’s Catch Up: An NFL Podcast</a>.
