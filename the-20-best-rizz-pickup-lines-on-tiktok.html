Are you Elsa? Because I can’t let you go.</h3><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>This one is clever, but it may work best when used for Disney fans specifically.</p><h3 id=h-2-are-you-a-vape-because-i-ll-never-use-you data-injectable=false>2. Are you a vape? Because I’ll never use you.</h3><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>This one is good, because it shows your crush that you care about your health and will be around for longer because you have a healthy respiratory tract.</p><h3 id=h-3-math-is-boring-because-it-s-always-talking-about-x-and-y-and-never-u-and-i data-injectable=false>3. Math is boring because it’s always talking about x and y and never u and i.</h3><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>If your crush enjoys wordplay and hates math, this one is perfect. If they’re a mathematician, steer clear.</p><h3 id=h-4-my-crush-is-ugly-without-the-gly data-injectable=false>4. My crush is ugly without the “gly.”</h3><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>This is a good one, but you have to make sure you deliver it correctly otherwise they may think you’re calling them ugly, and that is negative rizz.</p><h3 id=h-5-are-you-fortnight-because-i-d-never-play-you data-injectable=false>5. Are you Fortnight? Because I’d never play you.</h3><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>This works on multiple levels. Not only are you proving that you’re a loyal suitor, but you’re also casually mentioning that you don’t waste your time on video games, so have more to spend with them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@hello.itsme.11 href=#>@hello.itsme.11</a><p><a title=rizz href=#>#rizz</a> <a title=followme href=#>#followme</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ballin_mvp • Friends" href=#>♬ original sound – ballin_mvp • Friends</a></figure><h3 id=h-6-are-you-my-father-because-i-ve-been-missing-you data-injectable=false>6. Are you my father? Because I’ve been missing you.</h3><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>You have to be careful here not to subtly convey that you have daddy issues. But, if your crush has the right sense of humor, they’re gonna love it.</p><h3 id=h-7-i-want-you-to-look-at-the-first-three-words data-injectable=false>7. I want you to look at the first three words.</h3><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>If you’re going to use this, it’s probably best over text. That way, they can fully understand it before getting confused and just walking away.</p><h3 id=h-8-no-pen-no-paper-but-you-are-still-drawing-my-attention data-injectable=false>8. No pen, no paper but you are still drawing my attention.</h3><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Again with the word play, honestly the best way to ask someone out. especially if they like art and/ or the 1997 film Titanic (I can’t draw you like a French girl, but you certainly draw my attention?). There are a lot of ways you can go with this, so get creative.</p><h3 id=h-9-are-you-a-disney-ride-because-i-ll-wait-for-you-forever data-injectable=false>9. Are you a Disney ride? Because I’ll wait for you forever.</h3><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>Honestly, it may be best to tell them this in line for a ride just to pass the time.</p><h3 id=h-10-are-you-jasmine-but-without-the-jas data-injectable=false>10. Are you jasmine, but without the “jas”?</h3><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>A line like this opener is really best written down, but can be very clever — especially if their name is Jasmine.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true><a title=@g1rls_0nly4cc href=#>@g1rls_0nly4cc</a><p>𝓟𝓲𝓬𝓴𝓾𝓹 𝓛𝓲𝓷𝓮𝓼 𝓦𝓲𝓽𝓱 𝓡𝓲𝔃𝔃 𝓹𝓽 𝓽𝓱𝓻𝓮𝓮 || @𝐠𝐢𝐫𝐥𝐬 𝐱 || <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=fp href=#>#fp</a> <a title=tipsforgirls href=#>#tipsforgirls</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=fy href=#>#fy</a> <a title=rizz href=#>#rizz</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a></p><a title="♬ white tee - 🫂" href=#>♬ white tee – 🫂</a></figure><h3 id=h-11-my-mom-said-sharing-is-caring-but-you-re-all-mine data-injectable=false>11. My mom said sharing is caring, but you’re all mine.</h3><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>This not only shows that you’re a rebel, but it’s also incredibly smooth. But be careful that you don’t convey too much disrespect for your mother. Some people don’t like that.</p><h3 id=h-12-tie-your-shoelaces-i-don-t-want-anyone-else-falling-for-you data-injectable=false>12. Tie your shoelaces, I don’t want anyone else falling for you.</h3><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>You should probably only say this when their shoes are actually untied, or at the very least, they have shoes with laces on. Otherwise, it’s just confusing.</p><h3 id=h-13-no-more-pick-up-lines-but-you-can-pick-me-up-at-nine data-injectable=false>13. No more pick-up lines, but you can pick me up at nine.</h3><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>This is basically modern-day poetry, and if you can Dr. Seuss someone into going on a date with you, then you’re set for life.</p><h3 id=h-14-are-you-the-eiffel-tower-because-eiffel-for-you data-injectable=false>14. Are you the Eiffel Tower? Because Eiffel for you.</h3><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>Bonus points if you whip this one out in Paris. Or say the pickup line in French.</p><h3 id=h-15-can-i-get-your-jersey-because-i-want-your-name-and-number data-injectable=false>15. Can I get your jersey? Because I want your name and number.</h3><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>You have to make sure they actually play a sport that involves jerseys, but if this works, you not only get to wear their jersey, but you may also have their number.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true><a title=@pickuplines028 href=#>@pickuplines028</a><p>Rizz pick up lines!!<a title=fyppppppppppppppppppppppp href=#>#fyppppppppppppppppppppppp</a> <a title=uandi href=#>#uandi</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=rizzlines href=#>#rizzlines</a> <a title=wrizz href=#>#wrizz</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - tips✮" href=#>♬ original sound – tips✮</a></figure><h3 id=h-16-are-you-anxiety-because-you-make-my-heart-race data-injectable=false>16. Are you anxiety? Because you make my heart race.</h3><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>Lots of people can relate to feeling anxious, so honestly this works on all fronts, especially if you can transition from an anxiety attack to a pickup line. Ultimate rizz.</p><h3 id=h-17-can-i-borrow-a-kiss-i-promise-to-give-it-back data-injectable=false>17. Can I borrow a kiss? I promise to give it back.</h3><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>This particular line may be best used after warming up with a couple of other ones. But if it works, you’re golden.</p><h3 id=h-18-are-you-a-light-switch-because-you-turn-me-on data-injectable=false>18. Are you a light switch? Because you turn me on.</h3><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>This one is just a classic, and if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. It is especially clever if you or your potential suitor is an electrician.</p><h3 id=h-19-do-you-have-a-fever-because-you-re-hot data-injectable=false>19. Do you have a fever? Because you’re hot.</h3><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Another variation on the “you’re hot” line. Try not to scare them into thinking they actually have a fever. You want to woo them, not spook them.</p><h3 id=h-20-do-you-have-an-eraser-because-i-can-t-erase-you-from-my-mind data-injectable=false>20. Do you have an eraser? Because I can’t erase you from my mind.</h3><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Hopefully, they do not have an eraser, because if they do, it could really backfire. If not, they’ll hopefully be flattered and inspired to purchase school supplies.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Notably, the days of cheesy pickup lines seem to have returned, so why not hop on the trend? Obviously, this is just a starting point, feel free to get creative and make each and every line your own. and if you’re really feeling crazy, make some up yourself.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>To be clear, none of these have been scientifically tested, and there is no guarantee that they will work. But they’re definitely a step in the right rizz direction. Now that your first lesson is rizz is complete, you are ready to play the field and find out which very cheesy but very smooth pickup line works for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbTEZmlpZZKawLV50aKxs2WgnrCswc9mo6Kmlah6sLqMraCkrJ%2BgfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
