Brandi Glanville was the featured speaker on their podcast this week.&nbsp;During BravoCon in October 2022, Brandi revealed who was the rudest to her.

Tamara, according to Brandi, is a different person when she’s with Vicki Gunvalson.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Brandi-Glanville-1.jpg alt="Brandi Glanville" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Brandi Glanville spills the beans about how Tamara is around Vicki Gunvalson</h2><p>Brandi didn’t hold back when it came to discussing the Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season 2 on the podcast. According to the official summary of the podcast Two Ts and a Bada** B,</p><p>“THE TEA!!!!!!! This is one of the sexiest Twots ever, with Brandi Glanville on the hot seat. Who was the most obnoxious person at Bravo Con? Learn more. Will she be back on RHOBH? Learn more. What is the status of Brandi’s relationship with Kim Richards? Learn more. Most importantly, Teddi and Tamra get an update on Brandi’s dating life as she shares the best celebrity s*x she’s ever had and if she’ll ever marry.”</p><p>Brandi said how Craig Conover gave her the cold shoulder at BravoCon. Teddi urged Brandi to divulge a Tamara secret she discovered on the Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season 2. Brandi revealed:</p><p>“When she’s around Vicki, she’s an entirely different person. You become her sidekick, you don’t have an individuality, and it stinks. You were a lot of fun once she left.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Brandi-Glanville-2.jpg alt="Brandi Glanville" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tamara answered by stating:</p><p>“I have this thing where I feel obligated to look after her. And I believe she arrived to the Ultimate Girls Trip in a terrible mood.”</p><p>Tamra, according to Brandi, also fell into line. She also said that she knew what was going on, stating that she had been in a similar scenario.</p><p>According to Brandi Glanville,</p><p>“That’s what I get with LVP. I felt she was in command of me in the same way I did with you and Vicki.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipoaeSnXq0wMCrZJuqkaOxqnnGpZinrpmhuaZ50q2YrZ2UYsGprdNmq5qlkaeubq7EnJimnV2ZtqeyxKucp6xdpbKzv86nZJqqn6q7pXnVopqkoV2cwq%2FCwKWqqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
