Two years ago, Wren collaborated with her mom to create a special tribute to Bruce ahead of his 80th birthday.</p><p class=dh>Wren's mother is undoubtedly proud of the daughter she has, who she described as "amazing" in the video. The duo has a close bond and sometimes explores the outdoors, as seen in an Instagram <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgFS_-AMFWC/?hl=en">photo</a> of their mountain adventure together in Cape Town.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Wren Is Aware of Her Roots</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Born on December 14, 2002, as Wren Lee Keasler, Bruce Lee's granddaughter carries both her father's and mother's family names. Wren undoubtedly takes pride in being a Lee, thanks to her grandfather's legacy.</p><p class=dh>She is also involved in the Bruce Lee Foundation, which her mother runs. Wren showed her support when the organization launched its Youth Mental Wellness Now project and even shared the stage with her mom.</p><p class=dh>During the event, Wren rubbed elbows with hundreds of youth leaders and community activists to talk about mental health and the pressing concern to address it amongst today's generation. Although still young, Wren has already been exposed to humanitarian efforts.</p><p class=dh>In 2022, Wren reached a milestone as she celebrated her 20th birthday. Her mom paid tribute to her with a special Instagram post featuring a throwback photo of the celebrant alongside a recent picture.

Bruce was most recognized for his roles in titles like "The Big Boss," "Fist of Fury," and "Enter the Dragon."</p><p class=dh>An actor similar to him was <a class="me a" href=#>Steve McQueen</a>, who starred in "The Getaway" and "Papillon."
