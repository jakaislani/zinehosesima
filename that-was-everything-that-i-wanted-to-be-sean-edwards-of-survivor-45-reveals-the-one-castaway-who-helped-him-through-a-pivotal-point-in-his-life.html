I tried everything, everything to live a straight, faithful Mormon lifestyle, and because of those many, many years that I lost, Survivor for me was an opportunity to reclaim that lost time,” he prefaced, before explaining that he wanted to leave the game altogether.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>After admitting that his true “adventure of a lifetime” is back home with his husband, Sean asked for his tribe to vote him out that fateful night, garnering a stunned reaction from longtime host and executive producer – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Probst</a>.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>“I know how bad that all four of you really want this.
