Upon his arrival, he learns the town's odd secret. It seem that every 25 years during the Christmas season, an angel arrives at the local candle shop, owned by the Haddington family for generations, in order to bless one of their candles so that the eventual recipient will receive a miracle after saying a prayer and lighting the candle.</p><p>This strikes Rev. Richmond as utter nonsense and he tries to convert the townspeople from a candle-based form of faith to something more pragmatic by encouraging them to be miracles to each other via good deeds and simple acts of kindness. For a while, this progressive agenda seems to be doing the trick, but when Richmond tries to push his luck by installing some of those new-fangled electric lights in the church, the modern touch results in something more akin to Carrie's prom than the usual advent service. Throw in a mix-up involving the Christmas candle, and it appears that the hopes and prayers of all of Gladbury are doomed to go unheeded. After all, it would take a miracle for things to turn around, and what are the chances of that happening in a holiday-themed entertainment?</p><p>"The Christmas Candle" has received a bit of notoriety because it was produced by Echolight Studios, a concern whose CEO is none other than failed conservative presidential candidate and sweater-vest enthusiast Rick Santorum. Because of his presence behind the scenes, it is tempting to comb through the film for any possible references to his political agenda. For example, we are introduced early on to a spunky and modern-minded shopgirl (<a href=#>Samantha Barks</a>, whom you will recall for being one of the only worthwhile elements of last year's monstrous adaptation of "Les Miserables") but before too long, she is reduced to her presumed proper position of spooning broth and gazing adoringly at Richmond. Another character is a spinster whose sole prayer is to find herself a husband in order to make her life complete. To make matters even more amusing, this particular character bears a passing resemblance to none other that Rachel Maddow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZZOWu6W4xGZpaWlj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
