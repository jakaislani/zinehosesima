But many wondered whether the real estate agent always looked the way that she does. After her first season on "Selling Sunset," fans did a deep dive into Tiesi's past, and a resurfaced photo of her began circulating, showing some drastic changes in her appearance, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p>Back in 2021, however, the reality star said fans would be "disappointed" to know that she had only gotten two things done during a <a href=#>YouTube Q&A</a>, although she never admitted to what they were. It wasn't until she appeared on "Selling Sunset" that she confessed to a nose and boob job, per Page Six. But seeing photos of her past, fans weren't convinced that's the only work she has had, and their suspicions were right.</p><p>During an Instagram Q&A in 2023, Tiesi was asked what cosmetic procedures she's done, per <a href=#>People</a>. The reality star joked, "What haven't I gotten done?" Tiesi then shared every single procedure she could think of, revealing she's "down to do anything." She said, "I have had my nose done. I have had my boobs done. I've done filler, I have done Botox. I've tried literally everything. Kybella, Morpheus, like I just did a CO2 laser. I've done a ton of lasers." Tiesi divulged it all, and fans now know the work that has been done to make her look the way she does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkboRygI6cpqyllam2pHnPq6acnZSqv6a%2FjKycpaSZo7Ruv9SnnK1lkqeybsDInqqiZZGZuqrA0maenqyknruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
