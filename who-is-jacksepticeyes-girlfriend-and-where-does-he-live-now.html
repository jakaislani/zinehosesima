The duo has been dating since 2019 following Jacksepticeye’s breakup with Signe Hansen (Wiishu), a YouTuber from Denmark whom he had been dating since early 2015. Gab Smolders is also an internet personality; a YouTuber and Twitch streamer known for playing mostly horror games. She is from the Netherlands and was married to another YouTuber before her relationship with Jacksepticeye began.</strong></p><p><strong>Jacksepticeye publicly proclaimed in April 2019 that Gab is the best thing that has happened to him in recent times. The couple lives together in Brighton, East Sussex, England, and they have a cat named Big Boss as a roommate.</strong></p><p>Jacksepticeye is an Irish YouTuber and one of the most successful in the business. He joined the platform in February 2007 but only started uploading videos on his channel in November 2012. The following year, he got a shoutout from ace YouTuber <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>PewDiePie</a> and gained the attention he needed to build his fan base on the video-sharing platform. He milked every bit of the opportunity and now has over 27.2 million people subscribed to his channel with more than 14.2 billion views. Before he got famous, Jacksepticeye reportedly dated a Korean girl he met online and then saved up some money to met her in real life. The relationship failed just like his next one with Wiishu, but his latest girlfriend Gab Smolders seems to be the woman of his dreams.</p><h2><strong>Jacksepticeye’s Girlfriend Is a Dutch YouTuber and Twitch Streamer</strong></h2><p>One interesting fact you would probably appreciate knowing about Jacksepticeye’s girlfriend, Gab Smolders, is that she is older than the Irish YouTuber. It’s no secret that Jacksepticeye, whose real name is Sean William McLoughlin, was born on the 7th of February 1990, thus 33 years old. His place of birth was in Cloghan, County Offaly, Ireland. With that, we can affirm that his girlfriend is almost a year and 5 months older than him. Gab Smolders’ real name is Evelien Smolders and records have it that she was born on the 11th of September 1988. This means she is 35 years old.</p><p>You wouldn’t search hard to find that Gab Smolders’ boyfriend, Jacksepticeye, is the youngest of five children born to his parents, John and Florrie McLoughlin. He was raised in Cloghan and Ballycumber, both located in County Offaly, Ireland. The case is, however, different for Gab. Although it is known that she is Dutch and a citizen of the Netherlands, much is yet to be learned about her early life. But at some point, she lived in Japan and would later attend Leiden University in the Netherlands where she learned more of Japanese which has become a stable feature in the content she creates.</p><p>Gab Smolders is known for playing mostly Japanese horror games. Apart from her boyfriend, she has collaborated with other prominent content creators like iBallisticSquid, DanTDM, CaptainSauce, Egoraptor, TheRPGMinx, and others. As of June 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>her YouTube channel</a> has 652 thousand subscribers with over 81.9 million views; she created the channel on the 24th of September 2014. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Gab is also popular on Twitch</a> where she has 234 thousand followers.</p><h2><strong>Jacksepticeye and Gab Smolders Have Been Dating Since 2019 After They Met Through Mutual Friends</strong></h2><p>It was in early 2019, precisely on the 15th of March, that Jacksepticeye and Gab Smolders confirmed that they are in a relationship by sharing pictures on their social media pages. This came roughly six months after it emerged that the Irish YouTuber had parted ways with Wiishu. Jacksepticeye had announced the end of the relationship <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>via Twitter on the 9th of October 2018</a>, stating it was not an easy decision to make.</p><p>On the 16th of March 2019, a day after Sean and Evelien confirmed they were dating, the former disclosed that they had known each other for over a year. According to him, they were mutual friends with Arin and Suzy, who are also internet personalities. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>The Irish YouTuber revealed this on Tumblr</a> after a fan described him and Gab as adorable, asking how they met each other.</p><p>The couple has largely kept their relationship private but from the pictures on their social media pages, they seem to be very happy together. Jacksepticeyes once tweeted that Gab filled him with so much confidence and makes him smile a lot. As it is with the Irish YouTuber, Gab Smolders has also had relationships before Sean came along. Notably, she was married to TaiyouInc, a YouTuber whose real name is Pyke; they divorced sometime in 2018.</p><h2><strong>The Couple Lives Together In Brighton, England</strong></h2><p><strong>Jacksepticeye and Gab Smolders have been living together for a while. Albeit the precise location of their home is yet to be revealed, it is believed that they are living somewhere in Brighton, England.</strong></p><p>Jacksepticeye and his girlfriend are cohabiting. The duo lives with Smolders’ cat named Big Boss. When it emerged that the two were living together with the pet, people wondered how the Irish YouTuber has been able to cope as he had claimed to be allergic to cats. According to the YouTuber, there are no causes for concern as Big Boss has somehow helped him overcome the allergy. He has even been seen <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>cuddling with the feline several times</a>. The Irish YouTuber had previously lived with his ex-girlfriend Wiishu, also known as Signe Hansen, in Brighton. It was reported sometime in November 2015 that Wiishu moved in with him.</p><p>As claimed in some quarters, Jacksepticeye is unwilling to disclose the exact place he is living because of a previous experience. It is said that he had trouble dealing with fans visiting his home without any invitation. At some point, the YouTuber lived with a roommate named Killian who appeared in some of the videos he uploaded on his channel.</p><p>Before he relocated to England and settled in Brighton, Sean William McLoughlin was renting an apartment in his home country, precisely at Athlone in County Westmeath.&nbsp; During his teenage years, when his family moved from Cloghan to Ballycumber, they lived in a log cabin which was where Sean started his YouTube career. In November 2018, Jacksepticeye <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>visited the log cabin and tweeted about it</a>, stating it reminds him of the changes he has gone through and how fortunate he has been in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdn66kt9Kep62hk5rGpr%2BMoKCrpJantqa6w2aYp5xdrLWmvsRmm6ido2K1pnnLoq2eZZ6kxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
