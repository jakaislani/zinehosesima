We all know of several beloved celebrities (<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Cosby</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">R. Kelly</a></strong>, that pervert guy from Seventh Heaven) that are no longer beloved. But what about actors who haven’t done anything egregious? Can’t we hate them too? A new Reddit list is answering that very question.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Over on r/movies, an intrepid non-Bill Murray fan dangled a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tantalizing question</a>. What beloved actor do you hate?</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>Here’s what they said about Murray, by the way:</p><p>“His characters are always an ignorant asshole who respects no one else’s boundaries. Ghostbusters is a great example. I enjoy Scrooge at points and What About Bob but 90% of those movies he’s still ignoring boundaries or being a dick. Even Groundhog Day he’s a horrible human. I get he’s supposed to be the heel with a turn but damn it’s grating.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Personally, I think he’s describing the very reason people love Murray but what do I know? Of course, the actor has been taking some hits in the PR department ever since that movie he was on got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mysteriously shut down</a>.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>After the Reddit user’s hot take, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">floodgates opened</a>. This is fun! Who’s next?</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>“Can’t stand Kevin Hart. Not funny at all,” one user said. Here’s another Hart one: “I’ve listened to a few Kevin Hart podcast interviews and guy just moans the whole time. They’re supposed to be entertaining.”</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>Others pointed out Hart’s podcast Comedy Gold Minds where Bill Burr rips into him the whole time. It’s so funny. You can listen to that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>This one is probably less controversial: “Dwayne Johnson, has only one type of character he can play: himself, and no range whatsoever.”</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>Of course, no one is expecting Johnson to win an Oscar. Going after his bad acting is kind of boring. It’s more fun to go after his ego, like how he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shoehorned Black Adam into being a thing</a> and tried to take over the DC but failed miserably at both.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Here’s one this author agrees with: “Gal Gadot couldn’t act her way out of a paper bag.” How this robot woman who has the range of a deaf dog is a popular actress is beyond me. Literally nothing about her is likable, and as evidenced by her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dumb Covid song</a>.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>There’s also some political stuff with her but I’m not going to get into that. You have Google. In case anyone was wondering about her acting skills, someone posted this. It’s from Death on the Nile, by the way. Cringe city!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Next actor: “Mark [Wahlberg] same dude every fookin’ movie that’s sh*t is not acting.” I don’t necessarily agree with the sentiment but this person is kind of right. When does Wahlberg not play Wahlberg? It’s fine. Also, The Other Guys is a bonafide American classic.</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>Someone else made a good point. “Mark Wahlberg really isn’t a beloved actor though.”</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Here’s two more: “Julia Roberts for me. I have no idea what it is she’s done wrong to me, but she sets my teeth on edge. Also Hugh Jackman. NO ONE is that perfect. I see you Jackman.”</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>People seemed to take umbrage with this Jackman stuff. “I heard that Hugh Jackman once left the toilet seat up. He said it was on accident, but to me, it just sounds like he’s refusing to be held accountable,” one commenter said.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>“I heard Hugh Jackman once pulled an old woman out of a burning car, but he didn’t even&nbsp;try&nbsp;to save her CD collection. Those were worth at least tens of dollars, and he could’ve tried a little harder, you know?” another said.</p><p data-characters=59 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Alright, Jackson is a stretch. He’s hard to not like.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>Here’s one that everyone knew was coming: “Chris Pratt, he was fun in Parks and Rec and he is okay as Star Lord, but he is just a one note actor. It’s just Chris Pratt playing Chris Pratt as Chris Pratt. Dude has no actual range in his characterizations and can’t do anything beyond playing the sassy macho guy.”</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>The main contention with these actors is that they play the same character in every movie. Not everyone can be Paul Giamatti you know. And even he plays the same guy all the time, just better.</p><p data-characters=19 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Who are we missing?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SvqrjLZqSuqqKWxm6zwKVkoJmUpMFurc2dZKanopp6tbvPZquhnV2htrTAjKidZpqVoby3scNmmJysn6fAbsDHmqtmsZ%2BqeqStza1krKyRo7Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
