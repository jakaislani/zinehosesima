Yates was a stellar student and class valedictorian. In 1993, she married Rusty Yates, who was a disciple of preacher Michael Peter Woroniecki. Through sermons, videos and personal telephone calls, the Woronieckis condemned the Yates' for their hypocritical Christian lifestyle, saying their children were doomed to hell because of their parents sins. The Woronieckis also preached that married couples should have as many children as possible.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Psychological Issues and Murder</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1999, Yates was treated for postpartum depression and psychosis, illnesses that ran in her family. After the birth of her fifth child and the death of her father, she went into a severe depression and was forcefully admitted to Devereux-Texas Treatment Network. There, Dr. Mohammed Saeed prescribed a series of psychotropic drug treatments. He also abruptly tapered off the antipsychotic Haldol, a medication that helped Andrea recover in 1999. On June 20, 2001, during the hour between her husband leaving for work and her mother-in-law arriving, Andrea Yates drowned all five of her children in the bathtub.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Conviction</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout the trial, Rusty stood by his wife, claiming it was the illness and not Yates that had killed the children. She pleaded innocence by reason of insanity citing postpartum psychosis. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found Yates guilty of capital murder, sentencing her to life in prison with eligibility for parole in 40 years. That same year, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.yateskids.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Yates Children's Memorial Fund " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Yates Children's Memorial Fund </a>was established in memory of the children. Rusty divorced her during her incarceration in 2004 and remarried in 2006.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 6, 2005, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and on July 26, 2006, Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to North Texas State Hospital and in 2007 was transferred to Kerrville State Hospital.</p><ul data-node-id=13 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Andrea</li><li>Birth Year: 1964</li><li>Birth date: July 2, 1964</li><li>Birth State: Texas</li><li>Birth City: Houston</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Andrea Yates was a mother of five from Houston, Texas, who drowned her children.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Crime and Terrorism</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=16><ul data-node-id=18 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Andrea Yates Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/crime/andrea-yates</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 27, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6GdmnyiusOrnJplqZbBpr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
