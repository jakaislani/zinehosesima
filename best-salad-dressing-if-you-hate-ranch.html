I’ll probably be shunned by my people (Minnesotans) for even hinting at the idea that there exists a salad dressing that’s better than ranch, but I’m in the safe haven of Los Angeles, so let’s fire away. Creamy, herbaceous dressing isn’t for everyone and that’s okay—there are plenty of other options out there! I’ve rounded up five versatile and delicious options for those in need of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best salad dressing</a> if you hate ranch.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ken’s Steak House Country French Dressing with Orange Blossom Honey</strong></a><p>Does ranch have too many herbs for your taste? In your case, the best salad dressing if you hate ranch might just be French dressing. With not an herb to be found, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French dressing</a> gets its flavor from a combination of oil, vinegar, and sugar, and although it might seem basic on paper, Sporked senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> found that to be anything but the case in their taste test. Ken’s Steak House Country French Dressing with Orange Blossom Honey is tart, tangy, sweet—and, best of all, totally different than ranch.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best French dressing</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Organic Italian Dressing with Romano Cheese</a></strong><p>If you like herbs but steer clear of creamy salad dressings, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Italian dressing</a> is the perfect salad dressing for folks who hate ranch. And this Italian dressing from Trader Joe’s is a real good one. Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo really freaked for it. Honestly, based on his endorsement, I’m tempted to say this is this is the best salad dressing even if you don’t hate ranch. I mean, when’s the last time you heard someone describe any bottle of ranch dressing as “a prime example of perfect salad dressing alchemy”? The addition of Romano cheese really sends this one over the edge. Watch your back, ranch!</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Italian dressing</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s Goddess Dressing</a></strong><p>If ranch dressing just isn’t savory enough for you and your mouth waters when someone utters the words “umami and salty,” then I’d recommend Trader Joe’s Goddess Dressing (not to be confused with their green goddess dressing, which is in the refrigerated section). It’s made with a sesame-tahini base with added bursts of flavor from soy sauce and lemon juice—perfect for anyone looking for a nutty ranch alternative. Sure, it’s not as versatile as ranch (serving this with a plate of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buffalo wings</a> seems chaotic), but it’s the best salad dressing if you hate ranch and want to create a savory experience instead.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best green goddess dressing</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ken’s Steak House Thousand Island</strong></a><p>If you like what ranch is putting out but also crave the sweet-salty tang of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pickle relish</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thousand island</a> dressing is the right choice for you. Ranch can be put on a lot of things, but I’d draw the line at burgers…luckily, this is yet another thing that makes thousand islandthe salad dressing that’s better than ranch at getting the job done! Jordan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called Ken’s Steak House Thousand Island</a> “tangy, sweet, creamy, and salty,” all of which make it a perfect spread for a burger bun. I repeat: no one wants a burger doused in ranch!</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> best thousand island dressing</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chosen Foods Lemon Garlic</strong></a><p>Are you someone who just can’t get enough garlic into your diet? Someone who measures any garlic you put into a recipe with your heart instead of a tablespoon? Someone who is in desperate need of a salad dressing that’s better than ranch because no one can seem to fit enough garlic into the damn bottle? Chosen Foods Lemon Garlic salad dressing might just be the best salad dressing if you hate ranch. It has a powerful garlic flavor that’s balanced by a tangy, citrusy base. If you don’t care what your breath smells like after you eat a salad, this is a great alternative to ranch.
